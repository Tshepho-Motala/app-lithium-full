= Error Mappings

NOTE: The Generic Operator Wallet API (GGO) does not use HTTP status codes for business logic rules (i.e. returning 404 when an Account is not found). All responses should return a HTTP 200 status code and the error code returned in the response body will be used.

[TIP]
--
Mapping of internal Exceptions to Iforium Error codes is implemented in link:https://gitlab.com/playsafe/lithium/app-lithium-full/-/blob/develop/service-casino/service-casino-provider-iforium/src/main/java/lithium/service/casino/provider/iforium/handler/MainExceptionHandler.java[lithium.service.casino.provider.iforium.handler.MainExceptionHandler]
