= Questions / Issues

== General

//* *[LITHIUM]* - is IP whitelisting the most appropriate means of controlling access?

== Balance Retrieval

* *[LITHIUM]* - Does Lithium support game-specific balances?

* *[LITHIUM]* - Does Lithium support bonus balances? Funds priority?

* *[LITHIUM]* - There's a very odd line of code in https://gitlab.com/playsafe/lithium/app-lithium-full/-/blob/develop/service-casino/service-casino/src/main/java/lithium/service/casino/service/CasinoService.java#L122[CasinoService] that returns a zero balance when a use is not found - why??

== Temp Session Token

//* *[IFORIUM]* - Can iForium handle a temp token longer than `String[50]` ?
//** _If so, we can use a JWT_

//* *[IFORIUM]* - Does iForium support forward slashes in `OperatorAccountId`?

//* *[LITHIUM]* - Does Lithium support direct access to Hazelcast?
//** _If so, we can generate a UUID and store a mappinng in a short-TTL cache_

* *[IFORIUM]* - Are the Result or SessionToken elements required for a non-zero ErrorCode?

//* *[LITHIUM]* - Is it possible to _force_ the value of the player portion of the `uid`? i.e. `input` -> domain/`input`
//** It _may_ be possibly to leverage the GUID Strategy...

== Session Redemption

* *[LITHIUM]* - There is no obvious scenario where we would return an ErrorCode of `-4` (Account Frozen The account has been suspended / frozen by the Operator Wallet). Need to understand if this will be available at redemption or surfaced during transactions.
