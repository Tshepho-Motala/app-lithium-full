= Iforium Transaction Types

Iforium defines the set of `AccountTransactionTypeID` values to be  *_unbounded_* - that is, new values can be added at any time.

The current values can be found in
their link:gameflex/IforiumCommonReferenceData1.9.pdf[reference data] and are listed below for convenience.

IMPORTANT: What this means for us is that we can't map `AccountTransactionTypeID` directly to a specific `EBalanceAdjustmentComponentType`. The current implementation uses `EBalanceAdjustmentComponentType.CASINO_ADHOC_CREDIT` and records the `AccountTransactionTypeID` in `BalanceAdjustmentComponent.additionalReference`.
