== Session Management

`sid` is an attribute used in One Wallet API calls and represents playerâ€™s session ID.

A players session ID in context of Evolution is linked to a successful login event that can be found on `lithium_user.login_event`.`session_key`.

// To confirm
A player's session ID is validated against the players login event. If the players session key matches a login event associated to the player's userGuid, then the session should validate to true.

==== Create SID

On `/startGame` the player's access token will be used to get the session key from it.
