* link:https://jira.livescore.com/browse/PLAT-7130[PLAT-7130]

=== Gitlab
* Branch: origin/feature/LSPLAT-6361_PLAT-7130_Store_full_iDIN_response_in_DB
* MR: link:https://gitlab.com/playsafe/lithium/app-lithium-full/-/merge_requests/0000[]

=== Business

We want to store the full responses we get from iDIN, so we can improve our KYC/AML checks.

We receive the initials from iDIN, but we cannot confidently use this in automatic processes. We want to manually check the first initial in the initials sent from iDIN to any documentation the user sends in to us as this initial should be close to 100% accurate against their legal name.

On account creation, we want to store the full response as a changelog against the user.

We want to also store any iDIN logs created on registration which do not go through registration to check if they try and register at a later date, verify if similar details are used to create an account etc.

        * Should the iDin outcome be Expired or Cancelled, then the applicantHash needs to be removed from the LivescoreApp session and have the process re-started from STEP#1

note right of lsa
    * The returnURL is essentially a magic link, since it may be used by the LivescoreApp to load the registration screen with some of the players personal details prefilled

    Due to the nature of this API being open to the world and would essentially allow a hacker to resume with the players personal details prefilled, an SHA key needs to be calculated by the LivescoreApp
    to secure the call to Lithium when retrieving sensitive information.
    * To calculate the SHA, we will be using payload = apiAuthorizationId + "|" + iDinApplicantHash + "|" + sharedSecret, then MDA5'ed with a payload

* Note that stage 2 is of most importance here, as we will later make use of this response to log it to a changelog note.
