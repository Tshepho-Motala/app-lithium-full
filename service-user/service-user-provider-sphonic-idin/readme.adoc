= iDin registration
==================

== Timeouts
We need to cater for situation when the system experiences a timeout connection. When not handled this will result in
a system crush and can also be used to ensure the system performs optimally. In order to simulate a timeout connection error
we need to perform the steps below:

1. Login to LBO and go to provider settings and for iDin under the register tab
2. Under the iDin url setting replace it with : https://universal-router.stg.sphoniclabs.net/d03bd5dc-a450-4b23-a806-213bcf834224/TimeoutSim
3. You can change the timeout settings as well because the link points to a URL that points to a resource that runs an infinite loop
4. Execute your postman scripts to get the results
