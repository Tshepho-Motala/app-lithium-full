# Changelog service
## Synopsis
An internal only microservice that stores generic changes and notes on any entity within the system. It provides a simple API and client libraries for any service in the ecosystem to simply point towards an entityâ€™s before and after state, and it will generate change notes on the entity. It provides APIs that should be proxied by other services in order to verify security on a function by function basis, that allow for backoffice functions to embed change history almost anywhere within the system.
