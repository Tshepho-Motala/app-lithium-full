== Preface

The purpose of this document is to provide insights into the current as-is state of the reCaptcha implementation.

== Epics

* https://livescoregroup.atlassian.net/browse/PLAT-5500[reCaptcha v2] Not Implemented
* https://livescoregroup.atlassian.net/browse/PLAT-3148[reCaptcha v3] Implemented

== TA's

=== LSPLAT-530 - PLAT-1244 ⁃ Integrate Google's reCAPTCHA

TIP: Only reCAPTCHA v3 has been implemented as part of this ticket

https://playsafe.atlassian.net/browse/LSPLAT-530
https://jira.livescore.com/browse/PLAT-1244

https://playsafe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LITHIUM/pages/2313355274/ACCEPTED+LSPLAT-530+-+PLAT-1244+BE+Integrate+Google+s+reCaptcha[Intal TA]
- Takeaway from this TA was that initially the recaptcha was going to be built as a user provider service.

https://playsafe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LITHIUM/pages/2534342697/ACCEPTED+LSPLAT-530+PLAT-1244+BE+Integrate+Google+s+reCaptcha[TA addendum]
- We have revised where the reCaptcha logic will sit, and we will now need to move our checks to a new reCaptcha Access Provider service and have reCaptcha checks done as part of a pre-signup access rule; the provider would then make use of the provider properties to adjust the reCaptcha score

== How to enable reCaptcha on a domain

. Add svc-access-provider-google-recaptcha as an Access provider type.
. Create a new Access Control Ruleset with an external provider making use of the access provider setting created in step 1.
. Add the new ACR as a pre-signup access rule on the relevant domain in question.
. Add reCaptcha string as part of the register/v3 or register/v4 endpoint's PlayerBasic.additionalData.reCaptcha

TIP: The sequence diagram above has been reduced to only show the ACR execution points during the login (implicit login) and account creation flows. For normal login, the same flow as used in implicit login would be used internally.

==== reCaptcha v2

WARNING: Not implemented: see https://livescoregroup.atlassian.net/browse/PLAT-5500[EPIC: reCaptcha v2]

==== reCaptcha v3

* When registering a player with a reCaptcha string that was provided from the frontend, Lithium will pass the reCaptcha access control rule when Google has provided a `success` back, and our domains Access Provider settings has a configured score between 0 and 10.

IMPORTANT: Note that we do not evaluate whether the score returned is greater than or equal to our configured score, but this is something that we can do in the future, depending on business requirements.
