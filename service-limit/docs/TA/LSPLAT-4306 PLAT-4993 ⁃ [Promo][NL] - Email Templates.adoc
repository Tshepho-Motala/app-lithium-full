=== Tickets

* https://playsafe.atlassian.net/browse/LSPLAT-4306

== Description (From Ticket)
=== Background
As per PLAT-4693 we will be restricting customers access to Promotions when DWH informs us that the customer has triggered an intervention.

This story has been raised to ensure that when Lithium applies the auto blocking of Promotions to a customer. We also send that customer a Transactional Email, informing them why they have been blocked.

These will be templated emails, the same as we use today for Reset Password for example.

There will be 3/4 templates for the emails, one for each stage of Intervention the customer is entering.

For example:

 * Customer needs to be blocked from Promotions for 30 days, we need to email them Template 1
 * Customer is blocked for 60 days, Template 2 email should be sent to customer etc

=== Ticket Requirements

Lithium to trigger sending of Transactional Email (defined and created by CRM) upon auto restricting customers from Promotions for intervention purposes only
Email should not be triggered for reasons such as customer is under 24, or user opting out of promotions voluntarily
The sending/triggering of these emails should take place each time the customer triggers Intervention (as determined by data received by DWH)
