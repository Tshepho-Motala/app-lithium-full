/**
 * The Shutdownhook will gracefully shutdown the app.

 * 1. The Actuator Healthcheck will be down if actuator is used otherwise your implemented ProbeController
 * Rest Service /ready is set to false so it will return 404
 * 2. Thread.wait with the configured wait time will cause the shutdownprocess to wait.
 * This is necessary to give Openshift time to execute the readyness Probe. Once the readynessprobe is false,
 * Openshift Removes the Pod for future Requests
 * 3. All Open Requests will be finished.
 * 4. After waiting the configured estaGracefulShutdownWaitSeconds, the applicationContext will be closed.

 * For the ShutdownHook to work, you need to
