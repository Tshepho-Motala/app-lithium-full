# Comps Engine ChangeLog

## [Unreleased] - 2022-10-04

Here we write upgrading notes for brands. It's a team effort to make them as
straightforward as possible.

### Added
* [service-reward]
** A new endpoint to list all the games for a reward provider by reward type (e.g. get all free spins games for roxor)
{{gateway}}/service-reward/backoffice/livescore_uk/games/{{provider}}/{{rewardtype}}. reference https://www.getpostman.com/collections/8fcd466dd998b039b16b
** The reward create reward endpoint now expects a gameId and gameName to be sent, this is an attempt to simply object construction on the reward providers and
    to help FE with friendly game names instead of game guid. reference https://www.getpostman.com/collections/8fcd466dd998b039b16b
