* _Filter to apply bonuses to 1st/2nd/3rd/Xth deposit/ next deposit_
** See above
** We *do not* have 'next deposit' option

* _Ability to add a filter by offer type, so there is no need to manually exclude users from another promotion.
  E.g. option to exclude other types of welcome offer within the promo setup_
** We *do not* have this.
** Could add a 'disqualifying bonuses' option under restrictions to list other bonuses. So if one of those bonuses have been taken up, then player is not eligible for this bonus?

* _Ability to mass exclude/include users from receiving deposit bonuses (for potential abuse)_
** mass bonus functionality
