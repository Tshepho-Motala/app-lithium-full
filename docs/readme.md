# Lithium Documentation

This manual is intended for new users with little or no experience using the Lithium system. The goal of this document is to give a broad overview of the main functions of Lithium and some basic instructions on how to set up and use the back office. This document will concentrate on demonstrating interaction with Lithium back office using the web interface.

Every effort has been made to ensure that this document is an accurate representation of the functionality of Lithium. As with every software application, development continues after the documentation has been released so small inconsistencies may occur. We would appreciate any feedback on this documentation.
