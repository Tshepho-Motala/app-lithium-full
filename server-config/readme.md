# Config server
## Synopsis
Spring Cloud Config - A microservice that uses git as a storage facility to store service configurations. The default configuration points to a setup that is simple to use for local developers. For example, it will look for a rabbit MQ running locally rather than in a cluster, as well as look for databases and other dependent services locally based on default ports and authentications. It represents a runtime version of application.yml.
